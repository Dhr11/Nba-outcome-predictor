Predicting the outcome of the match before hand
Creator : Dhruuv Agarwal

Experiment/Hobby: 
Try to predict the outcome of NBA games before they take place. Aim is to learn and practice the complete workflow of a data science project while doing something interesting and in which domain knowledge is available.

The tasks involved:

1. Getting to know the data sources as there was no dataset known for this available.
2. Building the dataset by scraping.
3. Feature engineering from those scraped tables to have some valuable info.
4. Try different models to understand what model and features suit the problem.
